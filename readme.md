# Software Radar
This project aims to develop Software Defined Radars using Software Defined Radios and easy to obtain parts. This radar concept reduces the amount of analog components needed to an amateur level. Currently, two types of radar are available, but more are comming soon! This project is developed using the Open-Source framework GNURadio Companion and Python for most of the tools.

## Supported Radars
- Single Frequency Continuous Wave Doppler Radar

## Future Radars
- Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Radar
- Passive Pulse Radar
